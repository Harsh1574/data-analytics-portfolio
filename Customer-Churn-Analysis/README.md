# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + Python + SQL)

## 🎯 Objective: 
To analyze customer churn behavior, identify key factors influencing attrition, and deliver actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

---
## 🧠 Overview

This project presents an end-to-end **Customer Churn Analysis** for a telecom company.<br>
Starting from **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis** in **Python**, moving through **SQL** segmentation, and culminating in an interactive **Power BI dashboard**, the goal was to uncover behavioral patterns behind customer churn and derive data-driven recommendations for retention strategies.

## 🧹 Data Preparation (Python)

- Performed data cleaning and transformation using Pandas:

- Handled missing and inconsistent values (TotalCharges nulls converted, data types fixed).

- Removed duplicates and whitespace inconsistencies.

- Standardized categorical columns (title case, unified naming).

- Created tenure_band and mc_quint (Monthly Charge Quintiles) for segmentation.

- Exported clean dataset → [`telco_dataset_cleaned.csv`](.Datasets/telco_dataset_cleaned.csv).

📁 File Location: `./Datasets/telco_dataset_cleaned.csv`

---

## 🧮 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

**Libraries Used:**
`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

- Performed detailed EDA to identify churn drivers:

- Churn distribution & overall rate

- Tenure vs Churn % trend

- Contract Type vs Churn Rate

- Monthly Charges & Payment Method influence

### 🖼️ Preview Charts:

## 🧩 SQL Analysis
A few SQL queries were written to validate churn trends and segment data before Power BI visualization:

sql
```
SELECT Contract, 
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS ChurnRate
FROM telco_churn
GROUP BY Contract;
```

**📉 Highest churn: Month-to-month customers (42.7%)**

**📈 Lowest churn: Two-year contracts (2.8%)**

**🔍 High-risk segments:**

  - **Fiber Optic** internet users (41.9% churn)

  - **Electronic Check** payments (45.3% churn)

**🧩 Custom DAX Tooltips:** Provide contract-wise, internet, and payment breakdown insights

**🎯 Interactive Slicers:** Contract, Internet Service, Payment Method, Gender, Senior Citizen

## 🧩 DAX Logic Example

DAX
```
Churn Rate % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Churned Customers],
    [Customers],
    0
)
```

DAX
```
Contract Donut Insight =
VAR ContractType = SELECTEDVALUE(telco_dataset_cleaned[contract])
RETURN
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    ContractType = "Month-to-month",
        "Majority of short-term customers use Fiber Optic Internet and" & UNICHAR(10) &
        "Electronic Check payments, which strongly link to higher churn risk.",
    ContractType = "One year",
        "Balanced distribution across internet and payment types indicates moderate loyalty;" & UNICHAR(10) &
        "opportunities exist to convert to longer-term plans.",
    ContractType = "Two year",
        "Stable and diversified base with higher share of Credit Card and Bank Transfer users" & UNICHAR(10) &
        "representing the most loyal customer group.",
    "Select a contract type."
)
```
